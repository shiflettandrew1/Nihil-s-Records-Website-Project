        Brian Eno HAS announced his new album ForeverAndEverNoMore, the ambient pioneer and producer extraordinaire's first LP featuring mostly songs with vocals in nearly 17 years.
        And guess who pre-ordered a LOT of copies :)

    <p>
        One of the most appreciable features of William Basinski's work is his pessimism, sorrow and anguish in the face of a world that offers no security, 
        but also shows an individually creative path of making oneself, despite all circumstances. 
        This specific album demonstrates a provocative attitude towards human insecurity derived from the crisis of an existence that seeks prosperity in a world full of misery.
